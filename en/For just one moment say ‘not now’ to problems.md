We wait.

And we will wait for a long time before the rest we long for is finally here, because problems are endless.

We tell ourselves it will be just a little longer, but the truth is, we are shattered.

Our problems and responsibilities are vital, and we assign them a specific time and resources. But we may not consider our well-being part of the list.

We postpone the time for ourselves to an uncertain future when everything is in order. Yet, there is always something coming up.

So we present people with excuses and apologies, we delay reading our book, the project we have, drinking water, walking in the park, getting sun, or stopping for a couple of seconds to catch our breath.

We deny ourselves the very thing that provides meaning to the struggle, the small victories, the stop at the milestone, the rest before we take another step.

The time we are looking for is much closer than we think, and still it escapes our eyes. We must learn to reserve such space for enjoying ourselves and say ‘not now’ to problems when they try to intrude.

# The ability to say ‘not now’ to problems

The idea of a time for ourselves where we put aside problems momentarily comes from a fragment of the story of Steven Universe.

At some point, the main characters are plagued by a myriad of pressing issues; they are caught in a pointless war that will destroy the world, lose friends, and the ones who are left are divided by betrayal. Everyone is bleeding, lost, and fatigued.

Among this chaos, the characters decide to celebrate a wedding. That may seem absurd and out of place. Yet, such an occasion is the best they could have done.

The wedding is a symbol of rest, a break from everything they are dealing with, a small victory towards their goal, a reminder of the very thing they are fighting for.

We need exactly that.

Despite the awful amount of awful things, we need to leave them aside momentarily, or say ‘not now’, and enjoy the time we reserved for ourselves.

It can be a literal wedding, or going for a cup of tea, going hiking, or even a couple of minutes to breathe, or to splash cold water on our face. After all, problems aren’t just emergencies; they are the basis of life and growth, and they will always be there.

# A time for catching our breath

Reserving time for us is paramount, especially if we understand that problems never end.

Waiting for a problem-free moment to give ourselves time makes no sense. In the same way we reserve time and resources for our duty, we must do the same when it comes to us.

So, we do, and say ‘not now’ to problems. We regain strength to continue, remember why we do what we do, and we can catch our breath.

When we come back to our problems, we not only enjoy more energy, but also a new perspective, new ideas, and solutions may occur to us; the problem doesn’t seem as complex as before. More importantly, we are exercising the ability to focus on what we want, instead of what is being offered to us or what is urgent.

# What saying ‘not now’ looks like

We need to reserve a fixed amount of time and space for ourselves regularly and commit to it.
Taking care of problems

Reserving time for ourselves is not a synonym for neglecting our problems. We have to spend a certain amount of time on them, make preparations, and take action.

We may not solve everything in a day, but we must do our part today. So when the moment we reserved time for comes, focusing on our treat and leaving aside the rest of the world is easier.
Our time

Then, we routinely schedule time for ourselves. We should pick a moment to do only one thing; we don’t have a conversation while swimming, so avoid multitasking as much as possible. We also have to remove the external distractions and treat it with the importance of an appointment with a doctor.

Some days, that time comes from spending time with people or attending an event. On others, when we are by ourselves, we set a specific time and date, like 25 minutes to an activity on Saturday.

We can even snatch a minute or two, even seconds, between our duties; we stop completely what we are doing to shift our attention to our breathing, relax our shoulders, or splash our face with cold water.

Initially, problems are still present in the back of our minds. Yet, we just acknowledge their presence. We know it is there; we don’t push it away or hide it, but continue anyway. If an idea comes to us from outside our activity, we write it down on a piece of paper for later. That way, we ease the urge to do it now and keep precious ideas.

The mix of emotions associated with problems, along with tranquility and enjoyment from our activity, is awkward. However, we don’t let that disturb us either; sour-sweet is still better than plain sour. Gradually, problems will dissolve to be only echoes, and our activity will prevail.

# Reserve  time for yourself, however small

The problem was never the problems themselves, but the delay of time for us to an uncertain future.

We don’t have to wait until all problems disappear to enjoy ourselves; otherwise, we may need a comfortable chair for the waiting.

So amid chaos, the wide range of emotions and problems we can have, we say ‘not now’ to them and reserve a time for ourselves where we will find rest, be renewed, find a small victory, remember what the struggle is for; A laugh, the warmth of the sun, learning, sensations, company, a cup of tea, silence, or even taking up more problems to solve.

Slowly, the boundaries of our time become stronger, and despite what problems come our way, we will have somewhere to return to when we feel shattered.

We wait no more.
